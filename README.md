# AutoDoc

This was originally a class project for CS3560 at Ohio University, but the original repo had a lot of unused code and went untouched for quite a while until I came back to it.

# Why use it?

I intend on making this tool incredibly customizable so that you can easily take all of the repetitive work out of documenting your code

# Todo

* Backend
    * Implement all regexes for main supported languages
        * Improve regexes to cover all data types (and custom)
    * Multiple file support
    * ~Strip all useless functions from the backend~
    * ~Create backup files before editing the file~
* Frontend
    * Read json for comment formatting rather than use hardcoded strings
    * ~Remove child windows by using lift/place and Page classes~
* CLI
    * Implement it
